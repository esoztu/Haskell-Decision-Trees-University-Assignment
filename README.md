# Haskell-Decision-Trees-University-Assignment
This repository contains the Haskell implementation for COMP5450 Assessment 1 at Kent University, which focuses on decision trees as used in machine learning, particularly following the method introduced by J. Ross Quinlan. The goal is to build a model that predicts whether to play tennis based on weather conditions.
